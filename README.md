# Object Oriented Programming Exercise

Project status: Completed

Project Objective: The purpose of this project was to understand object oriented programming using python. I have wriiten a code to simulate the way such diseases spread, to better understand how this happens. The necessary data structure was created to simulate social links and disease transmission between people, simulate infections among the population over a period of time, and plot graphs to determine whether an outbreak is contained or not.

Method used
1. Object Oriented Programming 
2. Simulation
3. Probability
4. Inheritance
5. Visualization

Technology: Python

Project Description: The dataset used for this project is available at the dataset of LastFM. This project was build to understand the basic of object oriented programming. In the past, there have been viral disease epidemics (including the 1918 influenza pandemic) which have got out of hand. We would like to simulate the way such diseases spread, to better understand how this happens. In this assignment, I have created the necessary data structure to simulate social links and disease transmission between people, simulate infections among the population over a period of time, and plot graphs to determine whether an outbreak is contained or not. The model weâ€™ll use is a simplification of the real world; we will not use actual parameters or consider all important factors.
